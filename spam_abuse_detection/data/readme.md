# Data Folder

This folder contains the datasets for the Spam and Abuse Detection system.

- `raw/`: Contains raw datasets like the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Dataset or SMS Spam Collection Dataset.
- `processed/`: Contains preprocessed datasets ready for training and testing.

Make sure to preprocess data from the `raw/` folder using the `preprocess_data.py` script before training.
